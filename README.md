Yet another blogging platform - just practicing. 

The goal is to play around with modern software development techniques to produce:
- Something moderately complex
- Built/Deployed using in a fully cloud CI/CD environment.
- Developed using TDD and automated test
- Secure 
- React on front end with swappable backends.
- Nice to have Cloud Netural.
- API driven which doesn't necessarily mean microservice but could. 
- Support multiple UI's

A secure blog that can be one button deployed on AWS, GCP and Azure.
